# Using the Makefile

A Makefile is here to help you build and launch the Docker image.

## Targets

* build: Builds the image
* run: Launches the image
* launch: Builds and launches the image

## Usage examples

### Build the image
__make build__

### Launch the image in interactive mode.
__make run__

### Build and launch the image
__make launch__


## Notes
The environment variables IMAGE_NAME and TAG are used to define the name and version of the Docker image.

The launch target is a composite target that executes the build and run targets in order.
